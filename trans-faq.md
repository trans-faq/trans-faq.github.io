## Is being trans a choice?

Gender identity, or unconscious sex, has a biologic basis ([source](https://doi.org/10.4158/ep14351.ra)). While choosing to transition is a choice, the causes that motivate people to transition, like gender dysphoria, are not a choice.




## Is it normal to experience nipple pain on estrogen?

Yes, this is likely due to [breast budding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_bud), which is the onset of boob growth which normally happens during the onset of female puberty. 

Sometimes estrogen can cause breast tenderness and nipple pain even when the breasts are not growing, but when beginning estrogen breast tenderness can be greater and is related to the initial breast growth.
