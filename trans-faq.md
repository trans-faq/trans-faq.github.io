## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How many trans people are there?

It is not exactly clear. 

In 2022, the Williams Institute [estimated](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Pop-Update-Jun-2022.pdf) around 0.6% of people 13 or older identify as transgender in the United States. In the same year, [Gallup surveyed](https://news.gallup.com/poll/470708/lgbt-identification-steady.aspx) 10,000 U.S. adults and similarly found 0.6% identified as transgender. Likewise, [the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/07/about-5-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-say-their-gender-is-different-from-their-sex-assigned-at-birth/) surveyed a similar number of U.S. adults and found 1.6% identified as transgender or non-binary. 

It would not be unreasonable to guess that between 0.5 - 2% of the U.S. population is transgender. 

Depending on how you define transgender, this number could be much higher - if it's just having a gender different than the sex you were assigned at birth, the estimate is as much as 5% in young adults (according to that Pew Research survey). 

In the Gallup poll, 

- 1.9% of Gen Z respondents identified as transgender, while
- 1% of Millenials, 
- 0.3% of Gen X, 
- 0.2% of Boomers, and
- less than 0.05% of Silent Generation identified as transgender. 

The reasons for this are likely complex, for example the AIDS epidemic killed many trans people in those older generations (HIV is more common in trans women because they are more likely to end up sex workers, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_health_care#HIV_in_transgender_people) for an overview). Boomers, born between the 40s and 60s, were in their 20s - 40s during the peak of the AIDS epidemic in the 80s and 90s ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22298746/)). 

Increased [social acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_tipping_point) in the U.S. and [reduced medical gatekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPATH#2001%E2%80%93present) of transgender people also likely plays a role in how many people come to understand themselves and publicly identify as transgender. 





#### How do you know if you are trans?

Unfortunately, there is no blood test or objective measure that provides material evidence that you are trans. 

Desiring to be a gender other than what you were assigned at birth is a key sign, as that is not typical for cisgender people to feel. For example, a cisgender person who was assigned male at birth who is raised as a boy does not typically wish to live and be a woman - this is an example of a sign that you might be transgender. 



#### Is being trans a choice?

Gender identity, or [subconscious sex](https://www.juliaserano.com/terminology.html#subconscioussex), has a biologic basis ([source](https://doi.org/10.4158/ep14351.ra)). While choosing to transition is a choice, the causes that motivate people to transition, like gender dysphoria, are not a choice. 


#### Is it normal to experience nipple pain on estrogen?

Yes, this is likely due to [breast budding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_bud), which is the onset of boob growth which normally happens during the onset of female puberty. 

Sometimes estrogen can cause breast tenderness and nipple pain even when the breasts are not growing, but when beginning estrogen breast tenderness can be greater and is related to the initial breast growth.
